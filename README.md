# google-analytics-reporting-dashboard

This application was an extension of Microsoft Access and was developed to generate monthly reports for clients. Being the first
program I wrote outside of a few "hello, world"s and static websites, it was incredibly buggy, inefficient and poorly designed.
Instead of hiding this from the outside world, I wanted to give it some space on my GitHub as a sign post for when I developed a
passion for programming and as a point of comparison for measuring my own progression.
